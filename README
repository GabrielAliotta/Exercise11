This project gives a Manager Storage class that replace the default methods
added by Xcode when you create a project with core data. This class called
ManagerStorage gives the availability to check if the context was changed
and the availability to save the current context.
The methods are: 
- (BOOL)contextHasChanges;
- (void)saveContext;

Second, and regarding the implementation of the entities, you can use the 
"defines" gives by the header SynthesizeStorage.h. These defines are:
# SYNTHESIZE_MANAGEDOBJECTCONTEXT: 
  implement the getter to managedObjectContext property.
# SYNTHESIZE_FETCHREQUEST(entityname, key):
  implement the getter to fetchRequest property.
# SYNTHESIZE_ENTITIES
  implement the method entities.
See the EntitieStorage class as example to implementation of the "defines"
above.

This project also provide a unit test case "testTimeStorage". This test
add Time entities (see data model included in project) and save them
in the DataBase
